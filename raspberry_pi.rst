Board History
*************

The Raspberry Pi was created in Febuary 2012 by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Oringially setup to promote and teach basic cimputer science in schools and colleges around the UK. They initially released 2 Devices the Model A and the Model B, these computers ranged in spec and cabilities. Soon after the release of these products a community was formed and thousends of “Tech-Heads” bought one and started to create new projects with it, for instance one pjroject was to setup a Home Media Centre and play the popular game Minecraft.

The products were so popular due to their cost ranging from $25 – $35 (£17 – £23) they were efficient and durable which made them easy to modify and create projects on, The device ran Linux a popular OS for developers due to it being open-source.

On the Raspberry Pi website they created 2 images that could be installed easily onto a sd card which would then act as the OS for the device, one of the images was based off of Debian a popular lightweight Linux OS and was called Raspbian, the other was called Raspbmc and was based off the popular media centre software Kodi (Formally known as XBMC).

In Feburary 2014 they had been reported to have sold 4.5 millions boards, soon after this success they released the Model A+ and Model b+ which provided more GPIO’s and used less power to run. In early 2015 the Raspberry PI 2 was announced with increased Mhz by 200 to bring it to 900Mhz and doubled the ram to make it 1GB.
